carpe diem
hello world
i like milk
see spot run
run spot run
make lemonade
the dog barks
seize the day
little bo peep
the tea is hot
rock a bye baby
deeds, not words
once upon a time
the band is loud
love conquers all
mary took the bus
the cat is fluffy
look at the cloud
it is a sunny day
just keep swimming
the train was late
it is cold outside
this cake is sweet
you are my sunshine
baa baa black sheep
the long day is over
all work and no play
the tourist was lost
a sailor went to sea
the sunflower is tall
walking my dog is fun
please feed the bunny
the die has been cast
we went to see a movie
please wash the dishes
swing low sweet chariot
row, row, row your boat
thus the cookie crumbles
joe waited for the train
cats can hear ultrasound
when you wish upon a star
always stay one day ahead
the book was on the table
ice cream is a tasty treat
he was eager to eat dinner
when life gives you lemons
art is long, life is short
twinkle twinkle little star
humpty dumpty sat on a wall
the cow jumped over the moon
i will eat all five hot dogs
you can lead a horse to water
we will ride on the blue boat
it was a story as old as time
two wrongs do not make a right
when in rome, do as the romans
through adversity to the stars
texas biomedical device center
jack and jill went up the hill
life is a chance to grow a soul
the entire team shouted for joy
the turnip fell off of the truck
o danny boy the pipes are calling
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
can i play with that big red ball
a snail can sleep for three years
thus passes the glory of the world
a dream is a wish your heart makes
it is a beautiful day on the beach
the pen is mightier than the sword
today i will go to the planetarium
honeybees can recognize human faces
the herd of bison is moving quickly
a weed is only a flower in disguise
sticks and stones may break my bones
she was waiting for the rain to stop
a cheetah is the fastest land animal
the two boys collected twigs outside
we can laugh about those eight clowns
we climbed to the top of the mountain
today i made a funny picture at school
look at that little girl play the drum
he was between a rock and a hard place
you cannot teach and old dog new tricks
discretion is the greater part of valor
the car drove the long and winding road
most of the time i sleep better at home
i found a green pen to write the letter
i have seven books about forest animals
his composition needed many corrections
do not make a mountain out of a molehill
the way to my heart is through my stomach
a faithful friend is the medicine of life
friends are flowers in the garden of life
i washed my hands because they were dirty
before i start to read i turn on the light
there was confusion when the train stopped
